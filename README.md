## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview

The **Python.org News Scraper** is a lightweight Python script that fetches and displays the latest news and event updates from the official [Python.org](https://www.python.org) website. It uses web scraping techniques with the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to extract headlines, publication dates, and related URLs from the Python community's event section. The goal of this project is to demonstrate basic web scraping in a clean, efficient, and beginner-friendly way.
